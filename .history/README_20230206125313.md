## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./public/desktop-screenshot.PNG)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extention language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript

### What I learned

During the development of the "Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor", I learned to use various tools and technologies, including:

Vite: I learned to use the Vite framework, specialized in React application development, to streamline the development process, creating efficient production builds and leveraging the benefits of ES Modules.

Typescript: I learned to use Typescript to add typing to my Javascript code, preventing errors and improving the quality of my code.

In addition, I learned other important concepts such as development best practices, accessibility, and others, that will assist me in future projects.

_**HOT-TOPIC**_: I have to use HashRouter insted of BrowserRouter to make it work in production, after creating the build. I resolve the problem after searching in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51974369/what-is-the-difference-between-hashrouter-and-browserrouter-in-react/51976069#51976069). Exemple:

import React from 'react'
import { Routes, Route, HashRouter} from 'react-router-dom'
import { MakeAdviceGenerator } from '../factory/pages'

const App: React.FC = () => {
return (
<HashRouter>
<Routes>
<Route path='/' element={<MakeAdviceGenerator />} />
</Routes>
</HashRouter>
)
}

export default App

### Continued development

- Implementing more advice categories and sources;
- Adding the functionality to save the generated advice;
- Adding the functionality to share the generated advice on social media platforms;
- Adding dark mode support for better accessibility;
- Improving the performance of the app with techniques like lazy loading;
- Adding internationalization support for different languages;
- Implementing a backend to store user generated data and provide more personalized advice.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0gpCCA8ZPs&t=3402s) - This helped me understand Clean Architecture and be able to implement it in this project

## Acknowledgments

I want to mention the people who helped me in this project. Even though the help was not direct. I learned how to implement Clean Architecture from the channels MongoDB and Full Cycle. They are amazing at explaning it and for creating a full video on how we can do it ([Full Cicle site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0gpCCA8ZPs&t=3402s) and [MongoDB site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV1wQ6GFH0A&list=PL9aKtVrF05DyEwK5kdvzrYXFdpZfj1dsG)).
